# Snake Game

This project was a large project which I used to learn about collision detection and Classes.

## What was used

I used HTML, SCSS and Javascript to create this game. The snake head is constantly checking for collisions on the outer-bounds & the rest of the snake (which would trigger a game over) as well as the 'fruit' which increases the user's score and increases the length of the snake by one.

To make this app even better, I would add firestore functionality so that a scoreboard could be made.
